# Based Browser

No logs,no ads,no prying eyes and comes with a built-in chromium user-agent so your traffic will not stick out. Paired with a solid VPN using this browser can aid you in avoiding unwanted detection.

As we know no browser is truely anoymous, as who ever owns the exit nodes - owns the traffic. Every single 'security' browser has telementary being sent back to some monolithic company that since their product is free - sells your data and even with a VPN said monolithic company can still track you (exit nodes). The differences with this browser are not only is it open-source, with it all being local - you are the exit node; meaning your data is not logged in any capacity by us - meaning there is nothing to track via your browser.
